Subject: Request for Leave for Wedding Preparations

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inform you of a significant personal event â€” my wedding, which will take place on 13th February. As part of the preparations, I am seeking your understanding and support in requesting a three-week leave (from 3rd February to 21st February) to manage the arrangements.

Given that I do not have a father, my mother, who is elderly and physically unfit, is unable to handle the necessary rituals and tasks associated with the wedding. As a result, I will be fully responsible for organizing and overseeing all preparations during this time.

I fully understand the impact this may have on my work commitments, and I will ensure that all pending tasks are completed prior to my leave. In addition, I will remain available and reachable should any urgent matters arise during my absence.

I plan to send the soft copy of my wedding invitation by 10th February for your reference.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration. I am hopeful for your approval and look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
